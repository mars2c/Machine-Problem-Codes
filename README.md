# Machine-Problem-Codes
A compilation of machine problems from my first year up to third year, as of to date.  

NOTICE:
> For CMSC 23, parts of the code has been provided to us by our subject teacher, as we were still newly introduced to Python by this time. Our task is to complete the codes so that it
can turn into a functioning code.
